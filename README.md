This is a simple demo project developed using pure HTML and CSS to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Itâ€™s an offline, two-player game where both players take turns on the same device. The main objective of this project was to explore how basic web technologies can be used to implement interactive logic without JavaScript.
